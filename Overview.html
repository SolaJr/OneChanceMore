<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:104.25pt;margin-bottom:
8.05pt;margin-left:0in;background:white'><span style='font-size:24.0pt;
font-family:"adobe-garamond-pro",serif;color:#111111'>Overview</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-13.5pt;margin-bottom:
10.0pt;margin-left:1.0in'>Facebook local is a mobile social media app that
allows users to find Facebook events occurring near the user. While this app
has the potential to provide people with spontaneous outings, access to unknown
events and plan an event solely from their cell phone, it doesn’t seem to be
getting the kind of popularity one would expect. While it is difficult to
compare the main mobile Facebook app (which holds ~<b>90</b> million reviews on
the Google Play Store) to its partner apps such as Facebook Messenger(which
holds ~<b>62</b> million reviews on the Google Play Store), apps like Facebook
Local are nearly unheard of (with only ~<b>10,000</b> Reviews on the Google
Play Store). It is shocking to see that such a useful app is being ignored by
the general public, so I am going to try to find a potential reason.   </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Facebook Local Renovated</h1>

<p style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:
1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>A Case Study on my findings during a 48-hour design
challenge. I decided to analyze an app that presently existed but didn't hold
more than 10k reviews on the Google Play Store. I chose this because reviews
are often written when someone has an extremely good or bad experience using an
app. And on average only 15% of the people that download an app will leave a
review without a special reason. Therefore, if an app had a very low number of
reviews, it could mean that the app could have room for revision or another app
on the market fill the app's niche better. I ultimately was surprised&nbsp;when
I&nbsp;discovered how Facebook Local only had about 9K reviews on it when its
parent and sibling apps such as Facebook Messenger held millions of reviews. So,
I decided to dive in and learn as much as I could about the interface
associated with Facebook Local.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Overview&nbsp;</h2>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'><strong>Purpose of the project</strong>
- To learn what could improve the number of people using Facebook Local and get
a larger number of reviews.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'><strong>Objective</strong> - I
needed to develop: a wireframe that worked just like Facebook Local, conduct
research on negative reviews, and create a second wireframe using the results
from the research.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'><strong>Approach</strong> - I
decided to go through my design process the way I have on my previous projects:&nbsp;
Learn, Explore, Select, Develop, Refine, Deliver.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Learn</h3>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Learn about the users, the
app, other competitive products, and modern research.</p>

<h4 style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Users</h4>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Now, as expected, this app is
meant to be used directly in conjunction with Facebook. So, the app relies heavily
on people informing people of Local events based on their interests and liked
groups.&nbsp; However, despite the app covering many potential needs of a user,
it does have the ability&nbsp;to overwhelm a user. For instance, after
surveying some engineering students, I learned many students cannot keep their
main Facebook app's notifications on because they know they will get sucked
into seeing live feed and updates and stories that they would rather see later.
This fear of viewing certain&nbsp;notifications prevents them from seeing all
possible notifications such as local events occurring&nbsp;in one's neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>This means that the main
people that would use an app like Facebook local are the people that would also
not want to view every single notification that comes though as it comes
though. This type of app could be useful to everyone with access to Facebook. Whether
it be&nbsp;people who work at a desk all day or students that need to prevent
procrastination. The target audience for this app could possibly be any person
that wants to be involved in their community but is also too busy to view every
Facebook notification. During my survey I found a few additional answers, but
for the focus of&nbsp;this 48-hour challenge, this will be the main group I
will be targeting: busy young adults and adolescents that use Facebook regularly.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>App&nbsp;</h4>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>So, it is possible that
Facebook developed this app fully aware of that issue. After all, it would be
an effective way to get people to stay on Facebook even if they can't spend the
time to use the entire app. But no matter the reason, let's discuss the apps
purpose. Its main functions are it has all the capabilities of Facebook's
events pages but all on a mobile device. Every function and feature that events
on Facebook have can be found here. It allows users to see which of their
friends are going to a certain event, display interests in possible events, and
ultimately discover new events. For the purpose of these 48 hours, these are
the functions I will focus on.&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'><strong>Competitive&nbsp;Products&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>Due to the niche market of
this product, I will ignore competitors for this case study outside of
Facebook.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>User Feedback</h2>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-13.5pt'>So, I looked for some user
feedback that could be remedied by some beneficial product design alterations.
Now some of the complaints for the project were somewhat unfixable for this
challenge. For instance, several people didn’t like how they couldn’t find any
events in their rural hometowns located on the side of a mountain while and&nbsp;others
had issues with the app crashing and going slow. Without knowing the nature of
the events in every given area or the code layout of the app, I am incapable of
making an improved product on those two fronts. But here were some reviews that
were common that I thought were very fixable. &nbsp;</p>

searches, however going back to FB I can find what I was searching for. I
really wanted to like this. Hopefully there is a revamp soon.”</p>

reinstall and see if things have improved.</p>

margin-left:103.5pt'>Some of the reviews pointed out how they uninstalled the
app extremely close to the when they installed it. That means that we only have
a short amount of time for people to try this app before running back to the
original product. So the first thing that should be changed is the title
screen. I wish that this app had a title screen or a loading screen to help
prelude the apps function while it’s gathering data instead of showing the
signature place marker icon. It is so common with competitors different loading
screen may give it a different vibe within the first few minutes of usage. </p>

color scheme since it has a slight remanence of Facebook’s color scheme while
lacking the sharp edges associated with the main Facebook Apps. And since fades
in color make images seem more welcoming on time tested art, so it seemed like
an appropriate introduction to the main app.( <span class=MsoHyperlink><a

</span></span>Create a streak system! Like going to a Health event once a week
or a visit a convention once a year. While this won’t get everyone in the
Facebook community involved, the ability to overcome something with someone
else is a valid method to get others informed of this app’s existence (https://blog.stormid.com/the-psychology-of-sharing/).

</span></span>Possibly a System for how many events you go to with a certain
friend may be a method. A more practical solution is to make it so the app can
also highlight if certain friends will arrive at certain events. This system is
more simple then the streak system but basically all it does is create a
highlight for each person that has been to 5+ events with the present app user.
That way, people will be less likely to uninstall the app if this visibility
function is emphasized. After all, if you are going to an event that has 10 of
your Facebook friends, you may not care unless one of them is one of your
closer friends. This perk would be something that the present Facebook Event
system is lacking, and it could be beneficial to this app</p>

</span></span>This app may also need an improved marketing plan. When I google “Facebook
Local” with quotes over the past year, only 170 results appeared. And often
they weren’t about Facebook Local; search engines typically just found results
that included the phrase “Facebook. Local” </p>

</span>As a programmer, I understand that NONE of the changes I have suggested are
very “simple” or easy to make. Anyone can be an anonymous critic, but the true critics
are the ones that analyze the beauty of the program that was developed. I will
remember this because I personally found the user design of Facebook Local as
an aspiration more then an assist. </p>
